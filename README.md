# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project (Google Colab)

This is a beginner-level machine learning project built using Python and Google Colab. It predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, passenger class, and more. The project follows a step-by-step workflow inspired by a public YouTube tutorial.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `titanic_project.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all code, written and run in Google Colab

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (in Google Colab)
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic dataset available publicly via [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It includes passenger data like:

- Name, Age, Gender
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Embarked Port
- Survival status

---

## 🔍 What the Notebook Does

1. Loads Titanic dataset from CSV
2. Performs data exploration (`head()`, `info()`, etc.)
3. Handles missing values (`fillna`)
4. Converts categorical values (like 'Sex' and 'Embarked') using `get_dummies()`
5. Selects important features
6. Splits data into training/testing sets
7. Trains a Logistic Regression model
8. Evaluates model accuracy using `accuracy_score`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open this notebook in **Google Colab**  
   👉 [Click here to open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SabaImran17/titanic-data-project/blob/main/titanic_project.ipynb)

2. Run each cell step-by-step using `Shift + Enter`

3. You can also upload your own version of the dataset if needed
